	This is my interpretation of the classic arcade game pong. I programmed this using the p5js framework which I am currently new to. As
	I learn more about using the framework I may come back in the future and add features which are currently missing or would make the game 
	more enjoyable. For the sake of bugs in the game I have added a ball position reset by LEFT CLICKING. Enjoy.
